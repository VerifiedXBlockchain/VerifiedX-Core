# VerifiedX Core-CLI
For more information and to follow latest news go to:
https://verifiedx.io

This repo is currently a work in progress. New commits pushing more of the VFX wallet are staged. Keep an eye out for releases to test the blockchain.
During January we will be committing multiples stages of the code. Please follow to get latest updates!

# What is VerifiedX?
VerifiedX is an smart contract centric blockchain aiming to focus on SCs and deliver a blockchain built around them. 
VerifiedX Foundation (verifiedx.io), is the first open-source platform allowing for the creation of a decentralized NFT Centric Blockchain, which is independently governed and democratizes NFTs for everyone.

For more information please read the VerifiedX whitepaper or litepaper.

### VerifiedX Is Built on the Following ###

* VFX CLI Main Code REPO
* C#
* .Net 6.0 | https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0
* CLI
* Visual Studio 2022 | https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/

# Contributing to VerifiedX
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report written, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
I'm again borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

# How do I get set up?

**Summary of set up**

- For development Visual Studio 2022 is recommended for development. VS Code will also work, but not as much advanced debugging.
- For use setup is simple as binaries are pre-compiled for ease and you can compile them yourself too if desired. Wallet once opened does all initial setup.

**Configuration**

- Recommended to have at least 4gb of ram, and 4 core processor. Chain size is constantly growing, so ample hard drive space is recommended for long term use

**Dependencies**

- .Net Core 6 is only dependency for this project. Core is available on all platforms (Win, Mac, Linux)

**Deployment instructions**
- Please refer to the instructions in the RBXBuildInstructions.md. Below is a brief overview of what needs to be done.

- Install .net core 6 on your machine. Install can be found here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0
- Once .net is installed you can either download a pre-built binary or compile your own. 
- Deploy the wallet by either opening the ReserveBlockCore.exe or the GUI
- For Linux you can run the wallet with dotnet ReserveBlockCore.dll
